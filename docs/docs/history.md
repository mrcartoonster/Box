Feb 2014: Inception
-------------------

[Box]{.title-ref} was first
[created](https://github.com/cdgriffith/Reusables/commit/df20de4db74371c2fedf1578096f3e29c93ccdf3#diff-e9a0f470ef3e8afb4384dc2824943048R51)
under the name [Namespace]{.title-ref} in the
[reusables](https://github.com/cdgriffith/reusables#reusables) package.
Years of usage and suggestions helped mold it into the largest section
of the reusables library.

Mar 2017: Box 1.0
-----------------

After years of upgrades it became clear it was used more than most other
parts of the reusables library of tools. [Box]{.title-ref} become its
own package.

Mar 2017: BoxLists
------------------

2.0 quickly followed 1.0, adding BoxList to allow for further dot
notations while down in lists. Also added the handy
[to\_json]{.title-ref} and [to\_yaml]{.title-ref} functionality.

May 2017: Options
-----------------

Box 3.0 brought a lot of options to the table for maximum customization.
From allowing you to freeze the box or just help you find your
attributes when accessing them by dot notation.

Dec 2019: 2.7 EOL
-----------------

Box 4.0 was made with python 2.x out of mind. Everything from f-strings
to type-hinting was added to update the package. The modules grew large
enough to separate the different objects into their own files and test
files.
